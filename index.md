# MemoryCachingWebApi

This project is an example of using in-memory data caching

To demonstrate how caching works, a controller was created and data from the Northwind database was used

**What was used:**
+ Platform - ` ASP.Net Core 6 
+ Programming language - `C#`
+ Data storage - `SQL Server`
+ Data Base - `Northwind`
+ Data access -` Entity Framework Core`

***Next is an example of how caching works:***

**This is the speed of query execution for the first time**

**And this is the speed of query execution after the data has been cached in memory**
